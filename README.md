# Moko
A lightweight WebComponents based mobile JS lib.

Moko provides the basic stuffs you need in order to develop a mobile web app. Things like:

* a view controller (UIViewController on iOS and Activity on Android) with built-in render animations 
* a tab-bar (UITabBar on iOS)
* a navigation bar (UINavigationBar on iOS and Toolbar on Android)
* a drawer (DrawerLayout on Android)
* an hamburger icon

It also provides [React Navigation](https://reactnavigation.org) inspired navigators:

* a push navigator
* a zone navigator
* a stack navigator

A navigator handles routing aspects of an app and transitions between views. Tipical scenario are:

* Pushing a view on screen with an from bottom or from right animation (push navigator)
* Replacing the content of a view with another content ( zone navigator)
* Managing navigation through a hierarchy of views (navigation controller)
